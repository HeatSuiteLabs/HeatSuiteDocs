## What is HeatSuite?

HeatSuite was initially designed as an all-in-one solution to enable researchers to monitor key heat-health responses during periods of extreme heat. However, during its development, it was soon realized that it could be advantageous to various research domains. Although the core of the platform - even its name - give homage to its roots, its a platform that can do much more. Researchers have begun using it to monitor sleep, occupational performance, rural compared to urban health, and indoor air quality impacts on health. 

## What can it do?

The system is designed in this way so as to not limit researcher creativity or impose restrictions on what you can measure.
