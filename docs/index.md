# HeatSuite

New to HeatSuite? Start here.

## What is HeatSuite?

HeatSuite was initially designed as an all-in-one solution to enable researchers to monitor key heat-health responses during periods of extreme heat. However, during its development, it was soon realized that it could be advantageous to various research domains. Although the core of the platform - even its name - give homage to its roots, its a platform that can do much more. Researchers have begun using it to monitor sleep, occupational performance, rural compared to urban health, and indoor air quality impacts on health. 

## What can it do?

The primary usecase of the HeatSuite system is to monitor the health and behaviour of end-users in their natural environment, while retaining the same level of data control and governance that is offered within typical lab based environments. While this does come with some limitations, HeatSuite attempts to minimize them as much as possible.

## What do I need?

As HeatSuite is a modular system, you can pick and choose what you want to incorporate into your study design. The system is designed in this way so as to not limit researcher creativity or impose restrictions on what you can measure. If there is something you want to add or a feature you'd like to see, [let me know](emailto:nick.ravanelli@gmail.com). Below is a list of components within the HeatSuite system that you can select from to increase your level of monitoring. Again, you do not need all components, you can even just use the watch to create a fully governed data collection solution!
