# HeatSuite Watch App - Tasks

## What are tasks?

Similar to the question-based [ecological momentary assessments](watchapp-ema.md), you can also add tasks to your HeatSuite install for users to perform. The data collected from these tasks will automatically save to the watches internal storage for future downloading.

## What tasks are available?

In the current HeatSuite Watch App version, the following tasks are avialable:

* Blood pressure (requires A&D Medical UA651-BLE)
* Oral temperature (requires custom BLE dongle)
* Body mass & impedance (requires Xiaomi Mi Scale 2)
* Mictruition characteristics
* Nudging ecological momentary assessments
* 5 times sit-to-stand test (validation ongoing)

## How do I include tasks in my study?
